**Autonomous electric vehicles - PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Design and implement a microservice for an autonomous electric vehicle system with the following features:

    Check if the vehicle can reach the destination without charging
    Find charging stations - If the destination can not be reached with current charging level. 
    Appropriate handling to be done if the destination cannot be reached even with charging

**Build tool**

    Apache Maven

**Language**

    Java 1.8

**Steps:**

	1. On the command line

    		git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git

    	2. Inside Eclipse or STS

    		File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven project

   		 Then either build on the command line ./mvnw generate-resources or 
		 using the Eclipse launcher (right click on project and Run As -> Maven install) to generate the css. 
		 Run the application main method in class com.benze.assignment.BenzeTestApplication.java
		 by right clicking on it and choosing Run As -> Java Application
    
**Frameworks**

    Spring Boot
    Spring web
